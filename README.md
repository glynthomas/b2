# b2 brennan web app

brennan b2 original web interface (opinionated updates)

KISS keep it simple stupid, a focus on improving the web UI to play music & radio with excellence, zero feature bload!


## the good

it's a very useful high quality (wav & flac files) music & internet radio enabled web UI player

## the bad ( well not too bad )

the original development of the UI moved focus onto tagging & streaming youtube video music then entered a world playing music from USB sticks and other experimental features ...

## the ugly

constant polling the network for status updates? when the user is doing nothing (eating network bandwidth)

constant scrolling graph view of music playing or not playing ?

two devices active, music upload refresh bug (polling), more UI polling !

browser memory leak from constant polling

internet connection required for the web UI to load properly ( this now fixed )

## planned player upgrades ( When time permits ) ;

- fix the network constant poling problem

- fix any memory leak issues

- make any performance updates

- improve the web UI controls

- improve mobile web UI

* please note a brand new UI is being developed here ... https://github.com/geometryzen/brennan-app
