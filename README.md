# b2 brennan web app

brennan b2 original web interface [ opinionated updates ]

KISS keep it simple stupid, a focus on improving the web UI to play music & radio with excellence, zero feature bload!


## the good

it's a very useful high quality [ wav & flac files ] music & internet radio enabled raspberry pi based player

with a responsive web UI for desktop and mobile devices


## the bad [ well not too bad ]

the original development of the web UI brennan b2 box moved focus to tagging & streaming youtube video music,

after this, the development seemed to continue into a world of many experimental features, including;

USB sticks loading music, indexing USB sticks, bulk uploading of media, photo viewer and other non core features ...


## the ugly

constant polling the network for status updates? when the user is doing nothing [ eating network bandwidth ]

constant scrolling graph view of music playing or not playing

two devices active, music upload refresh bug

browser memory leak from constant polling

music file upload problems

radio drop out problems - [ fixed ]

internet connection required for the web UI to load properly - [ fixed ]


## web app upgrades [ when time permits ] ;

run through the ugly list ;

- fix the network constant poling problem

- fix any memory leak issues

- make any performance updates

- improve web UI controls

- improve mobile web UI

- implement version control

- clear up & clean old or redundant files 

web app will be maintained here together with any improved, tested brennan b2 system updates 

future development of the native web app at brennan.co.uk has been halted !

* new official experimental UI is being developed by brennan ... https://github.com/geometryzen/brennan-app 

if you are a b2 brennan owner and you stumble onto this page, and you prefer a simpler stable maintained version of this web app and want to contribute please get in touch :-)

###### * note these updates and fixes are at your own risk if you implement them on your own b2 player
