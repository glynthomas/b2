# b2
brennan b2 web interface (opinionated updates)

these are the files found currently on the b2 device

the good
it's a very useful high quality simple music (wav flac) file & internet radio enabled player

the bad (well not too bad)
the development somehow went into a world of wanting to tag & stream youtube video music?

the ugly
constant polling the network for status updates? when the user is doing nothing (eating network bandwidth)
constant scrolling graph view of music playng or not playing ?

internet connection required for the web UI to load properly ( this now fixed )

planned player upgrades ;

- fix the network problems
- make any performance updates
- improve the web UI controls
