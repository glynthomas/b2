# b2 brennan web app

brennan b2 original web interface (opinionated updates)

wish to KISS keep it simple stupid, just focus on improving the web UI to play music & radio with excellence, zero feature bloat!


## the good

it's a very useful high quality (wav & flac files) music & internet radio enabled web UI player

## the bad (well not too bad)

the development somehow went into a world of focusing on tagging & streaming youtube video music?

## the ugly

constant polling the network for status updates? when the user is doing nothing (eating network bandwidth)

constant scrolling graph view of music playing or not playing ?

two devices active, music upload refresh bug (polling), more UI polling !

browser memory leak from constant polling

internet connection required for the web UI to load properly ( this now fixed )

## planned player upgrades ;

- fix the network constant poling problem

- fix any memory leak issues

- make any performance updates

- improve the web UI controls

* please note a brand new UI is being developed here ... https://github.com/geometryzen/brennan-app

if you are a b2 owner and you stumble onto this page, and you like a simpler stable version of this web UI player and want to contribute please get in touch.

###### * note these updates and fixes are at your own risk if you implement them on your own b2 player.
