brennan b2 web interface (opinionated updates)

these are the files found currently on the b2 device

## the good

it's a very useful high quality (wav & flac files) music & internet radio enabled web UI player

##the bad (well not too bad)

the development somehow went into a world of wanting to tag & stream youtube video music?

## the ugly

constant polling the network for status updates? when the user is doing nothing (eating network bandwidth)
constant scrolling graph view of music playng or not playing ?
internet connection required for the web UI to load properly ( this now fixed )

## planned player upgrades ;

- fix the network constant poling problem
- make any performance updates
- improve the web UI controls

if you are a b2 owner and you stumble onto this page, if you want to contribute please get in touch.

## note these updates and fixes are at your own risk if you implement them on your own b2 player.
