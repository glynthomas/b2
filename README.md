# brennan web app

brennan b2 original web app interface [ opinionated updates ]

KISS keep it simple stupid, a focus on improving the web UI to play music & radio with excellence, zero feature bload!


## the good

it's a very useful high quality [ wav & flac files ] music & internet radio enabled raspberry pi based player

with a responsive web UI for desktop and mobile devices


## the bad [ well not too bad ]

the original development of the web UI brennan b2 box moved focus to tagging & streaming youtube video music,

after this, the development seemed to continue into a world of many experimental features, including;

USB sticks loading music, indexing USB sticks, photo viewer and other non core features ...


## the ugly

constant polling the network for status updates? when the user is doing nothing [ eating network bandwidth ]

constant scrolling graph view of music playing or not playing

two devices active, music upload refresh bug

browser memory leak from constant polling

music file upload problems

hash in the URL
